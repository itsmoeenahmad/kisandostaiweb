This design ensures that even farmers in remote areas with limited connectivity can access agricultural guidance. Just dial our number like any regular phone call, and you'll be connected to the AI assistant without needing data packages, apps, or internet access.

                    Currently, KisanDostAI is fully optimized for Urdu language, which is widely understood across Pakistan. The AI can understand various Urdu dialects and conversational styles to accommodate farmers from different regions. We are actively working on adding support for Pashto and Punjabi languages in future updates to make the service accessible to even more farmers in their native languages. Regional language support is a priority in our development roadmap.

It is an academic research and development project created as a final year project by Computer Science students at University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar, Pakistan. The project was developed under the supervision of faculty members with the goal of addressing real agricultural challenges in Pakistan through innovative AI technology. While it's an independent university initiative, we aim to collaborate with government agricultural departments in the future.

                    Yes, KisanDostAI is accessible from anywhere in Pakistan where you have mobile network coverage. Since it operates through standard GSM voice calls rather than internet connectivity, you can use the service from remote rural areas, mountainous regions, or any location with basic mobile phone signal. The service works with all major Pakistani telecom operators including Jazz, Zong, Telenor, and Ufone.

                    While the KisanDostAI service itself is completely free, standard mobile call charges from your telecom operator will apply. These are the same rates you pay for regular voice calls. We recommend using call packages or off-peak hours to minimize costs. We're actively working with telecom operators to potentially offer toll-free or subsidized calling options for farmers in the future to make the service even more accessible.
